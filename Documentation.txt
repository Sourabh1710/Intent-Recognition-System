Intent Recognition System Development
Developing an efficient Intent Recognition System is crucial for enhancing user experience and ensuring seamless human-computer interactions. The goal of this project is to design and implement a system that accurately classifies user queries or commands into predefined categories or intents using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This system will enable applications to understand user intentions and respond appropriately, making interactions more intuitive and user-friendly.

Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this project is structured in a JSON format and contains various user intents along with their corresponding text examples and responses. Here is a detailed breakdown of the dataset:

Intents: The dataset includes multiple predefined intents, such as "Greeting," "GreetingResponse," "CourtesyGreeting," "CourtesyGreetingResponse," "CurrentHumanQuery," "NameQuery," "RealNameQuery," "TimeQuery," "Thanks".

Text Examples: For each intent, there are several text examples that users might input. For instance, the "Greeting" intent includes text examples like "Hi," "Hello," and "Hola."

Responses: Each intent is associated with a set of predefined responses that the system can use to reply to the user's input. For example, the "Greeting" intent has responses like "Hi human, please tell me your UnivIn user" and "Hello human, please tell me your UnivIn user."

Extensions: Some intents include additional functionalities or extensions, such as updating user information or fetching current time.

Context Management: The dataset also handles context management, where certain intents require maintaining or clearing the context for accurate response generation.

Example Entries
Greeting Intent

Text Examples: "Hi," "Hello," "Hola"
Responses: "Hi human, please tell me your UnivIn user," "Hello human, please tell me your UnivIn user"
Context: Outgoing context set to "GreetingUserRequest"
GreetingResponse Intent

Text Examples: "My user is Sourabh," "This is Sourabh"
Responses: "Great! Hi <HUMAN>! How can I help?," "Good! Hi <HUMAN>, how can I help you?"
Context: Incoming context "GreetingUserRequest" and clears context after responding
TimeQuery Intent

Text Examples: "What is the time?," "What's the time?"
Responses: "One moment," "One sec"
Extension: Fetches the current time and responds with "The time is %%TIME%%"

Code Documentation
Library Imports
The code begins by importing several essential libraries that will be used throughout the project:

numpy: This library is fundamental for numerical operations. It provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
json: The JSON library is used to parse and handle JSON formatted data, which is the format of our dataset.
re: The re library is used for working with regular expressions, which are useful for text processing and cleaning tasks.
tensorflow: TensorFlow is an open-source platform for machine learning. It is used for building and training the machine learning models that will power the intent recognition system.
random: The random module is used for generating random numbers and performing random operations, such as shuffling the dataset.
spacy: spaCy is an open-source library for advanced Natural Language Processing. It is used for various NLP tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing.

Loading the NLP Model
The spaCy library is used to load a pre-trained English NLP model:
spaCy Model: The en_core_web_sm model is a small English model that includes vocabulary, syntax, and named entities. This model is capable of performing a wide range of NLP tasks and will be integral to processing and understanding the textual input in our intent recognition system.
